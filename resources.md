# Running List of Reference Material

Below is a running list of tools and reference material associated with those tools. Resist the [Toolbox Fallacy](https://www.process.st/toolbox-fallacy/#:~:text=The%20toolbox%20fallacy%20is%20self,start%20a%20project%20without%20them.). These are merely tools. You'll get a feel for when you need them and when you don't. Remember, sometimes, it is the archer and not the arrow.

### Markdown basics
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a powerful markup (hence the name) language. I find it to be very expressive, and most code documentation you see will be written in Markdown. There are ways to augment it and make it _extremely_ powerful, but we only need the basics right now.

### ssh tutorial
[This](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys) is a big article, but you don't need to get too far into the weeds with it. The first few sections should more than cover what we did. DigitalOcean is a web _platform_ that you can host things on. We'll likely use them when we deploy something later.


### git basics
[This](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) should be everything you need to know for now. Git is a deep well. It is extremely powerful; however, you won't need these advanced techniques outside or large scale engineering projects.
