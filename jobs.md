# Jobs and Internships

I would subscribe to the google group `jobsthatareleft@googlegroups.com `. They'll send an email daily of the jobs that are left (obviously). Look for paid internship positions for consulting firms and for non-director level jobs on campaigns. 

Something to keep in mind. VA and NJ have off year elections. You could totally get on a Lt. Gov or AG primary campaign and be done in the middle of the summer. If they win, great you can choose to stay. Lost? Great, now you can go have a normal summer or try to get on the winning campaign staff. More options is always better. 

I selected the ones below because I thought they stood out. Just scrolling through it will give a sense of what jobs there _are_ and can help you see what the higher level positions look like.

Disclimer: I have no idea what amount of money you need to make it work.

This seems like a crash course in political consulting. This would also be helpful to decide if you want to work on the hill.

This is definitely on the polling side. Also this is using SPSS which you have used before.

This one looks flexible. Also I like that they tell you how much you're able to work. Up to 35 hours is 3/4 time so if you end up loving it you can put in extra time. They give you a laptop and if you want to go to the DC office you can. Digital would also move you closer to data and the code side if you wanted to go that way. It's still good if not because it's so central to most orgs. I think you could get a lot out of this.

### Interesting Examples
[Example of a high level job you'd get after some campaigns](https://careercenter.gainpower.org/jobseeker/job/66463486/).

[State Senate CM](https://careercenter.gainpower.org/jobseeker/job/66461632/). State senate races are very interesting. You see a lot of state level politics play out. A deputy campaign manager on a state senate or Congressional race would also be something to look towards.

If you like the money side of things, [deputy finance director](https://careercenter.gainpower.org/jobseeker/job/66388057) would be a super good position to have.
